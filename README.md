# Comparative Genomic Analysis of the Human HBB Gene

This project performs a comparative genomic analysis of the human **HBB (beta-globin)** gene across selected vertebrate species. The goal is to explore sequence conservation, functional motifs, and evolutionary relationships using computational bioinformatics tools.

## Objectives
- Retrieve and curate HBB nucleotide and protein sequences
- Identify homologous sequences across species
- Perform multiple sequence alignment
- Analyze conserved regions in relation to function and disease
- Construct and interpret a phylogenetic tree

## Tools
- Python (Biopython, pandas)
- R (Biostrings, msa, ggtree)
- BLAST+
- Clustal Omega

## Project Status
Week 1: Data retrieval, homolog identification, and alignment
